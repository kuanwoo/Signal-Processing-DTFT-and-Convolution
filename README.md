# Signal-Processing-DTFT-and-Convolution
This project is about designing generalized MATLAB codes that perform discrete convolution and discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) to audio and voice signals. Signal-processing MATLAB functions like “conv”, “filter”, and “fir1” are used to manipulate the input voice signal with different filters and study the output spectrum.
